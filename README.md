# Star_Wars

This project was initially part of the Code Academy projects library, under the name "Visualizing the Orion Constellation". It focuses on 3D visualization. The first 3D visualization was semi-guided by Code Academy. I decided to go beyond this initial scope and to propose a way to modelize the Orion constellation in a nicer way but also to find a way to modelize any constellation in 3d.

This was my first work on 3d modelization and also with stars coordinates... hence the "wars" in the project name! I did not expect to see constellations so differently from what I can observe from my window.

There are many possible improvments to this notebook: to write a function creating coordinates based on star names, to accept declination and right ascension as the measures of stars locations, to improve the visualization features (zoom, dynamic names display, link the stars of the constellation), to improve the background (nicer 'sky'), etc.

I will probably come back to it after finishing another SciFy book :)

(3D visualization is not activated in github, I added pictures of the two constellations taken for illustration!)
